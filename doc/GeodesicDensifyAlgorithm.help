Densify a line or polygon vector layer by adding geodesic points in between individual line segments. This gives a nice smooth curved appearance. Geodesic lines are the shortest distance between two points on the Earth. For line vectors a geodesic line can be drawn between just the beginning and ending points.

* Input Layer - Select an existing line or polygon layer.
* Output Layer - Specifies the output layer that will be created in QGIS.
* Discard inner vertices (lines only) - When this is checked only the beginning and ending points of a line are used when drawing geodesic lines. This is not used with polygons.
* Maximum line segment length - This is the maximum length of a line segment before a new vertex is added along the geodesic path. This value defaults to the length specified in the "Settings" menu.
