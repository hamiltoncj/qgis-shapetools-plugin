Break a line into multiple geodesic segments when the line crosses the international date line (180, -180 degrees). This helps the visual display of the lines in some projections. 

Geodesic means that you are interested in the shortest path across the earth's surface between points and depending on the length of line segments, consider running the geodesic densifier on it first for the best visual appearance.
